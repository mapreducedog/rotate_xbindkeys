A "profile manager" for xbindkeys, 
use python rotate_xbindkeys --help for options

save your profiles in .conf files in the same folder.
if in the settings.json file no "profiles" attribute is defined, the profiles are the .conf files in the current directory.
otherwise, if a "profiles" attribute has a list of strings, it will consider the entries of this list as profiles to cycle through.
